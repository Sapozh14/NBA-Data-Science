### Main Purpose
The NBA has a lot of interesting statistics but there is a statistic that combines them all, under the name PER.
We will use it to estimate the success of the players in their season.

Our process is defining a research question ->  Web Crawling - >  Data Cleaning - > Visualisation - >  Machine Learning


Can we predict a player’s PER using machine learning based on his stats?
Can we predict a player’s PER in his next year using machine learning based on his stats?
Can we predict the 2021-2022 MVP of the year based on PER?


### Web Crawling
We got our data from : 
[basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html)
[basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html)
